# Scaphoid Fracture Classification

## Description

The final project was completed in the Spring 2023 semester for a course titled Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Digital Health Applications. The project's objective was to **classify a fracture in the scaphoid region of the hand**. Our team is developing a deep learning model that can differentiate between scaphoid fractures and non-scaphoid fractures from an X-ray image.

Scaphoid fractures can be classified into two types: apparent fractures and non-apparent fractures, also known as occult fractures. Apparent fractures are easily detectable using X-ray images, whereas occult fractures are challenging to detect using X-ray images alone. Therefore, additional secondary screening methods using MRI or CT scans, which are expensive and involve radiation, are necessary.

Our project aims to develop a model that can help doctors identify scaphoid fractures from X-Ray images, including occult fractures, more precisely without the need for costly and potentially harmful secondary screening methods.
